# Family Calendar Prioritization Plan

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a Home Assistant Panel Card that replicates the intuitive and visually appealing interface of the Skylight Max Family Calendar, optimized for a 20" touch display. This calendar will seamlessly integrate with Google Calendar, allowing users to view, add, and edit events directly from the interface. By incorporating swipe functionality and efficient performance, the calendar aims to provide a smooth and interactive experience, with future plans for additional integrations and features.

## Development Approach

1. Research existing solutions that would meet the high priority requirements and allow for customizations for the remaining requirements
2. Start with a basic prototype of Phase 1 features
3. Iterate through each phase
4. Gather feedback after each phase
5. Adjust priorities based on feedback

## Notes

- Focus on performance optimization throughout all phases
- Maintain Google Calendar sync as primary data source
- Keep UI clean and intuitive like Skylight Max
